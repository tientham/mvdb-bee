1. Inside Build.gradle, in order to support for libraries 26+, then:

If you are using Android Studio 3.0 or above make sure your project's build.gradle file looks like this-

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        google()
    }
}

For below Android Studio 3.0 and starting from support libraries 26.+ your project's build.gradle file must look like this-

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven {
            url "https://maven.google.com"
        }
    }
}
